## How Markdown affects my thinking
Writing in Markdown has really slowed my writing. I feel myself thinking a lot
about formatting and not about the content of my writing. Although Markdown as
a medium is taking a step towards the future, I feel like it removes the authenticity
of writing. Writing has always been a reflection of my thoughts, and the words
I choose and the syntax I choose to write in have always been a reflection
of my emotions. Markdown provides affordances such as more modern formatting
and better compatibility with publishing technologies. However, some limitations
I encountered while writing in Markdown is that I think about the presentation
of my writing while I write instead of after I have finished writing, as I
typically do in other text editors such as Microsoft Word.

### Why I like Markdown
+ You can do these bulleted list without using the mouse
+ You just type and don't have to fiddle with highlighting the words you
want to format
+ It is awesome because I can link my work through [github](https://github.com/tinawu0603)
and have my work linked to different stylesheets if I choose to do so in the future
+ I can convert it to different formats easily

### Why I don't like Markdown
1. I have to learn more things about formatting and think ahead about how I want
my writing to look
2. It takes away the *authenticity* of writing in that I can't just let my words
flow on paper
3. Staring at **monospace text** for a long time gets monotonous and the preview
of Markdown can differ from what it actually looks like
